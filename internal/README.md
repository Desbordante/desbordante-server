# Internal Module

## Description

This application is built upon the principles of Clean Architecture. Clean Architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to maintain, test, and scale. The architecture is structured to allow flexibility and independence from frameworks, which enhances the portability of the code.

## Structure

The internal module is organized into the following components:

- **Domain**: Contains the core business logic and entities. This is where the application's fundamental rules are defined.
- **Use Case**: Represents application-specific business rules and orchestrates the flow of data between the domain and external layers.
- **Unit of Work (UoW)**: Manages transactional boundaries and ensures that a series of operations can be committed or rolled back as a single unit.
- **Repository**: Abstracts the data access layer, providing methods for retrieving and storing entities.
- **Worker**: Provides abstractions for running background tasks and managing asynchronous operations.
- **DTO (Data Transfer Object)**: Handles the data transfer between use cases and the external world, ensuring that only the necessary data is exposed and passed around.

This structure facilitates maintainability and scalability by enforcing clear boundaries and responsibilities within the application.
